Step 9: Add Prometheus Data Source:

To visualize metrics, you need to add a data source. Follow these steps:

Click on the gear icon (⚙️) in the left sidebar to open the "Configuration" menu.

Select "Data Sources."

Click on the "Add data source" button.

Choose "Prometheus" as the data source type.

In the "HTTP" section:

Set the "URL" to http://localhost:9090 (assuming Prometheus is running on the same server).
Click the "Save & Test" button to ensure the data source is working.
Step 10: Import a Dashboard:

To make it easier to view metrics, you can import a pre-configured dashboard. Follow these steps:

Click on the "+" (plus) icon in the left sidebar to open the "Create" menu.

Select "Dashboard."

Click on the "Import" dashboard option.

Enter the dashboard code you want to import (e.g., code 1860).

Click the "Load" button.

Select the data source you added (Prometheus) from the dropdown.

Click on the "Import" button.

You should now have a Grafana dashboard set up to visualize metrics from Prometheus.

Grafana is a powerful tool for creating visualizations and dashboards, and you can further customize it to suit your specific monitoring needs.

That's it! You've successfully installed and set up Grafana to work with Prometheus for monitoring and visualization.
